**Welcome!**

This is my first team work. My friends from **"School 21"** participated in the project: ***Gaia, Timothy*** and ***Bulat*** _(BuZii)._
We created a program that solves Sudoku. 

# sudoku.c
The main sudoku.c file. Here you enter the numbers, and checking validity, filling the grid and in numbers and solving Sudoku. 

# checknumber.c
File checknumber.c fills the numbers horizontally, vertically, and squared. 


• Here’s how we’ll launch your program :
> ./sudoku line0 line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8

• LineN represents a characters string of values ranged between ’1’ and ’9’ or ’.’ (for
empty boxes).

# sudoku.h
Header file. Here written the function prototype.

# Example
• Here’s an example of intended input/output for a valid sudoku.

• In case of error, display "Error" followed by a line break.
